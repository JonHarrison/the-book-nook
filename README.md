# The Book Nook

## Description

The Book Nook is an e-commerce personal book library that allows users to sign up and login to search for books and add them to their own 'book nook'. This allows the user to digitise their home book shelves, enabling them to view, on the app, which books they have in their book nook (bookmark with tick icon) and which books they would love to have (heart with tick icon).

## Motivation

Our motivation was always geared towards the reader and their needs. The app enables for the cataloguing of the readers books enabling them to view their collections / libraries at the touch a virtual button. As avid readers ourselves we know how frustrating other apps can be, over-complicating their interfaces, adding way too much. Our approach use the KISS principle (nothing to do with 70’s glam rock at all) Its just “Keep It Simple Sweetie". With just the fundamental needs it keep to minimal systems usage allowing even those with slightly older technologies to keep upto date without having to upgrade to newer tech.


## Key Technologies and Features

List what technologies we used and why (especially the new ones). What features does the app have?

* HTML
* CSS / Bootstrap
* React
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* [emailjs](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/)   (EmailJS helps to send emails using client-side technologies only. No server is required – just connect EmailJS to one of the supported email services, create an email template, and use one of our SDK libraries to trigger an email)
* firestore
* firebase
* Framer Motion - This allows elements to have additional animation. With this being a new technology, we opted for an effect that occurs on hover and when an element is tapped, so we applied this to our icons in the search library area. We did this so we could experiment with new technologies but also reduce the risk of creating errors or bugs.

## Installtion
npm install - to install dependencies listed in the package.jason

## Future Development
* Add additional search and filter options to the search library.
* Allow the user to add their own book that isn’t in the API (author/title).​
* Enable users to track if they have read a book and how much of the book they have read.​
* Have functionality that allows users to add/contribute to a discussion page/review page/  or to rate the book.​
* Provide a page for a blog so that users can add comments to a blog/keep a blog about their reading.​
* If a user supplies their interests, the app theme tailors for that (e.g., changes colour for adventure or sci-fi interests).​
* Add an author link to search for books by the same author​
* Google Books offers a viewer API so the book could be read through the app​
* User Framer Motion in more advanced ways​

## Screenshots and Deployment

Our deployed app can be found at:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
